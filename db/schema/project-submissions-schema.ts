/**
 * @file project-submissions-schema.ts
 *
 * @description
 * Defines the "project_submissions" table for storing student PR submissions.
 * Each submission belongs to a single project, identified by `projectId`,
 * and includes the student's wallet address, plus the PR link.
 *
 * Now extended to store optional GitHub-specific fields to facilitate webhook matching:
 *  - repoOwner: the GitHub user or org name
 *  - repoName: the repository name
 *  - prNumber: the pull request number
 *
 * Key features:
 * - "projectId" references which project the submission is for
 * - "studentAddress" is the userâ€™s wallet address
 * - "prLink" is a string for the GitHub PR URL
 * - "repoOwner", "repoName", "prNumber" are optional but help us do an exact match
 * - "createdAt" is the timestamp of submission creation
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - drizzle-orm/pg-core for Postgres columns
 * - drizzle-orm for typed model inference
 *
 * @notes
 * - In an actual production environment, you'd add a proper migration if
 *   these columns didn't exist initially.
